## Brief Description

This repository contains the files for my first data analysis project based on the instructions from the [STAT 545 course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/) offered at UBC in Fall 2021. 

The dataset for this project is **vancouver_trees** in `datateachr` package, which is originally from [Vancouverâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.height_range_id) .

This project focus on the relationship study of the diameter/height of trees with age, planted area condition, geographical location and other variables.


## Files

The [mda_m1.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mda_m1.Rmd) shows how I choose the dataset for data exploring and the initial data wrangling and research on the chosen dataset. Research questions are drafted while still to be determined.

The [mini-project-2.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mini-project-2.Rmd) represents the summarizing and plots on 4 research questions and also show the work of tidying data with `tidyr` package.

The [mda_m1.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mda_m1.md) and [mini-project-2.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mini-project-2.md) are the markdown version knitted from above Rmd files.
