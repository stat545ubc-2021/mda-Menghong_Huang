Mini Data Analysis Project
================

\[Author\]: [Menghong(Rita) Huang](https://github.com/rossmaryHuang)

## Brief Description

This repository contains the files for my first data analysis project
based on the instructions from the [STAT 545
course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/) offered at UBC in Fall
2021.

The dataset for this project is **vancouver_trees** in `datateachr`
package, which is originally from [Vancouverâ€™s Open Data
Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.height_range_id)
.

This project focus on the relationship study of the diameter/height of
trees with age, planted area condition, geographical location and other
variables.

## Files

The source code and related files for each milestone are included in
folder
[milestone_1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/milestone_1),
[milestone_2](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/milestone_2)
and
[milestone_3](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/milestone_3)
respectively. Folder
[output](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/output)
contains files stored from exercise 3 of milestone 3.
