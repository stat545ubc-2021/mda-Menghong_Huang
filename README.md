# Mini Data Analysis Project

## Brief Description

This repository contains the files for my first data analysis project based on the instructions from the [STAT 545 course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/) offered at UBC in Fall 2021. 

The [mda_m1.Rmd](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mda_m1.Rmd) shows how I choose the dataset for data exploring and the initial data wrangling and research on the chosen dataset. Research questions are drafted while still to be determined.

The [mda_m1.md](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-Menghong_Huang/blob/main/mda_m1.md) is the markdown version knitted from mda_m1.Rmd
